SCHOOLS FOR NATIVES.

The number of Native village schools in operation at the end of 1916 was 118. In addition, there were thirteen private schools at which education for Maori boys and girls is provided. Of these ten are maintained from the incomes arising out of lands held in trust for educational purposes by various denominational bodies; the others are supported by private resources.

As required by law, instruction in all Native schools is given through the medium of the English language only. The subjects of the school course are English, arithmetic, drawing and handwork, nature-study and geography, health and moral instruction and civics, singing, and physical drill.

In a number of schools instruction in woodwork and in elementary agriculture is given, and the girls are taught practical dressmaking and plain cookery. In the majority of schools some form or other of elementary handwork is taken with success.

At one or other of the ten boarding-schools—Otaki, St. Stephen's (Auckland), To Auto, Waerengaahika, and Hikurangi for boys, and Hukarere, St. Joseph's (Napier), Queen Victoria (Auckland), Turakina, and Te Waipounamu Schools for girls—the Government provides a number of free places, tenable for two years, for children of predominantly Maori race who pass the higher standards at the Maori village schools. At the end of the year the number of pupils on the rolls of these schools was 457. Of the pupils in attendance 43 boys and 58 girls were holders of free places.

Senior free places for boys take the form of industrial scholarships, enabling the holders to be apprenticed to suitable trades—carpentry, black-smithing, engineering, or farming. These scholarships have not been of late eagerly sought after, the boys finding that they can secure higher wages in other ways, and no scholarships were held in 1910. The senior free places offered to girls take the form of nursing-scholarships. Four girls are training or about to begin their training as nurses in public hospitals under the scheme.

On the rolls of the 118 village schools at the 31st December, 1916, there were 5,132 children (including 572 Europeans), as against 5,191 at the end of 1915. The average attendance for the year was 4,504, the percentage of regularity being 86.8, and the average weekly roll number was 5,190. The total number of pupils on the rolls of the Native mission schools was 120, and on those of the secondary schools 457. At the end of the year, therefore, the total roll number of all the Native schools inspected by officers of the Education Department was 5,709, the average weekly roll being 5,789, and the gross average attendance, 5,054.

Besides the children of the Maori race who are receiving instruction in the Native schools there is a still larger number attending public schools; so that the total number of primary pupils of Maori race (including those in the mission schools) is 9,308, made up as follows:—
Attending Government Native schools	4,560
  " public schools	4,628
  " mission schools	120
 	9.308

Of the children on the rolls of the Native schools in December, 1916, 85.1 per cent were Maoris speaking Maori in their homes, 3.8 per cent were Maoris speaking English, and 11.1 per cent were Europeans. In connection with this classification it is to be noted that the term “Maori" applies only to children who are by birth full Maori, three-quarter Maori or half-caste, and excludes children who are three-quarter European.

The total net expenditure on Native schools during the year ended the 31st March, 1917, was £41,792. Included in this is the sum of £32,334 expended on teachers' salaries, £2,687 expended on new buildings and additions, £1,294 on maintenance of buildings, repairs, &c., and £2,465 on secondary education.

The staffs of the village schools included seventy-nine masters, thirty-seven mistresses in charge, and 131 assistants. The average salary of the head teachers was £182 19s. 7d., of the 123 female assistants £80 2s. 1d., and of the eight male assistants £65 12s. 6d.
