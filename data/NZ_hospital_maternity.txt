MATERNITY HOSPITALS.

There are five State maternity hospitals now open for the use of the public, and a property has been acquired at Invercargill which is shortly to be opened as a St. Helens Hospital in that district. The St. Helens Hospital at Wellington was opened in June, 1905, and a new and up-to-date building in July, 1912; that at Dunedin in October, 1905; that at Auckland in June, 1906; that at Christchurch in April, 1907; and that at Gisborne in November, 1915. This last hospital, established by the Cook County Women's Guild, was taken over by the State at the request of that Guild. During the year ended 31st March, 1917, a total of 1,071 confinements took place in the five hospitals named, and 523 confinements were attended by the institution nurses outside these hospitals, as compared with 798 and 563 confinements respectively (not including Gisborne) during the previous twelve months. These institutions are a development of the policy begun by legislation in 1901, when the Nurses Registration Act was passed, followed in 1904 by the Midwives Act, the latter providing that after a certain date only those midwives who were duly registered would be qualified to practise on their own account.

Tables are given showing information as to births and deaths in each institution during the year ended 31st March, 1917, and the totals for each of the past five years. Births in cases dealt with outside St. Helens Hospitals by the nurses attached to the institutions are also shown.
